this script will not stop its self, you will need to rejoin to stop the script.

do you want a script like this but with ui and way more options? try using - loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zackmackburnger/a/main/b", true))()
if it does not work DM freenixxie on discord

this will automaticly start on execute, if it does not its in beta testing.
